## Notes

I've had a realization for solving this one.
I can pass objects by reference, which will be memory efficient, and alse allow me to compare instances of objects.
With this in mind, I can create 2 representations of the data.

- A grid of cells, the usual representation.
- A global queue of cells.
  I will remove cells from here as they are added to groups.

I'll start at `[0,0]`, generating a group, and avoiding moving to any other group, and removing cells from the queue.
As cells are added to the group, I can keep a running total of borders, as defined by directions touching other groups.
Once I've exhausted the first group, I will then take the next cell from the queue, and process it's group, and so on.
Processing groups like this also prevents needing to look up any random cell to see if it's group exists.
